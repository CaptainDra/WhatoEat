# WhatoEat
Help you decide  your lunch  

For this application, I will make several function:   
Inventory - cookable function (done)   
Add user function (done, but need to polish in future)   
Using database to save more menu(modifying)   
Add recommand function(to do)   

This is how the system will work(for demo)

At first, the homepage is build by the model of Django,

Click the start, then we can see the inventory page where you can choose what you have:

After you confirm your inventory, the app will get what you can cook by your inventory.
